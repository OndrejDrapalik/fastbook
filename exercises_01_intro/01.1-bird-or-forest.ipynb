    "\n",
    "This code is defining a `DataLoader` object in the fastai library. The `DataLoader` is an object that loads and manages a dataset for training and evaluation of a machine learning model. The `DataLoader` is created using a `DataBlock`, which defines the rules for preprocessing and splitting the data into training, validation, and possibly test sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `DataBlock` is being initialized with the following arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `blocks`: This specifies the types of blocks that the `DataBlock` should use. In this case, there are two blocks: `ImageBlock` and `CategoryBlock`. The `ImageBlock` is used to load and preprocess images, and the `CategoryBlock` is used to handle the categorical labels associated with the images.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `get_items`: This is a function that returns the list of items (in this case, file paths to images) that the `DataBlock` should use. The `get_image_files` function is provided as the `get_items` argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `splitter`: This is an object that defines how the data should be split into training, validation, and possibly test sets. In this case, the `RandomSplitter` is being used to split the data randomly, with 20% of the data being used for validation (`valid_pct=0.2`). The `seed` argument ensures that the same split is used each time the code is run.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `get_y`: This is a function that takes an item (in this case, a file path to an image) and returns the corresponding label for that item. The `parent_label` function is provided as the `get_y` argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `item_tfms`: This is a list of transformations that should be applied to the items (in this case, the images) during preprocessing. In this case, a single transformation is being applied: `Resize(192, method='squish')`. This will resize the images to have a height of 192 pixels, while preserving the aspect ratio. The `squish` method will stretch the image to fit the specified dimensions while preserving the aspect ratio, which may cause the image to appear distorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the `dataloaders` method is called on the `DataBlock` object, with `path` and `bs=32` as arguments. The `path` argument specifies the root directory for the dataset, and the `bs` argument specifies the batch size for the `DataLoader`. The `dataloaders` method creates a `DataLoader` object and returns it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `show_batch` method is then called on the `DataLoader` object, with `max_n=6` as an argument. This method displays a batch of data from the `DataLoader`, with a maximum of 6 items per batch. This can be useful for visualizing the data and checking that it has been loaded and preprocessed correctly.\n"
